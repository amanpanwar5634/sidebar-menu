 #Sidebar Menu with Navbar Toggle Using HTML and CSS

In this project, I developed a responsive sidebar menu using only HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript or external frameworks. The sidebar is initially hidden and can be toggled to appear when a user clicks on a menu icon. Once the sidebar is revealed, it displays navigation links, which can be used to navigate through different sections of the website.

The key feature of this project is the seamless transition between the hidden and visible states of the sidebar, achieved purely through CSS. The sidebar also includes a close button, which allows users to hide the menu once they have made their selection.

This project showcases how CSS can be leveraged to create interactive and visually appealing navigation elements without relying on JavaScript, making it lightweight and fast.
